================

This, is a project for jxc to practise git operations, do what I like, anything in this respository.

I start to learn about git operations, like git start, git init, git puish, git add, git commit, git rebase, git pull commands, 
so this project is mainly for this reason, and here I have to build a project to simulate the situation I 
may come into in the future job.
